# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to redo watchandcode.com again to sharpen my javascript after Le Wagon bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Setting up the repo for the challenge and the first lectures were quite easy

### Day 2: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to redo watchandcode JavaScript course creating an object and functions inside it and read an article about hosting on namecheap blog https://www.namecheap.com/blog/choose-the-right-hosting-option/

**Thoughts**: Today I got really lazy, but the lectures were quite easy and made me think the ruby way to do them.

### Day 3: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued watchandcode JavaScript course to review and did some Ruby challenges to practice for job online screenings. Learned some cool stuff about array methods in Ruby and got stuck in a problem reggarding hashes and arrays in Ruby. I have to study that more.

**Thoughts**: It is getting harder to code everyday because sometimes I just feel like not coding, but when I start things begin to set in motion. The hardest part today were the Ruby challenges.

### Day 4: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued watchandcode JavaScript course and finished version 6. Applyed to some jobs and did some coding challenges for practice. Did an actual job challenge and screwed so bad, but I learned a lot.

**Thoughts**: I tried to do a lot of hard stuff today without succeeding as I wished, but everyday is a new learning and I get one step closer, each day, to understand the whole picture.

### Day 5: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a project with Middleman and deployed the skeleton to github pages. I got robbed today and I don't have my phone anymore. I couldn't continue this night to follow the watchandcode JavaScript course because I went home to block my number and cellphone.

**Thoughts**: I think that I'll start doing daily pages with Middleman because I learn the best by doing projects instead of readind a lot and following tutorials a lot. I'm best suited to learn a few hours and then spend the rest of the day mastering that knowledge.

### Day 6: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued watchandcode until the version 7 + the interlude. Found out interesting resources to take inspiration such as [Awwwrds](https://www.awwwards.com/), [The FWA](https://thefwa.com/awards/page/1/) and [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/c/web/resources/landing). I also put in my list to be studied: continuous integration, TDD (Ruby: RSpec and Capybara; JavaScript: Mocha, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme), Scrum and Kanban (notions of them) etc.

**Thoughts**: Today I had a lot of free time, but I used most of it to focus on relaxing, but still managed to learn as I wanted. I have to master Vue.JS as soon as I can and that may be my priority in October after I finish the basic javascript review and the ES6 review after that. Impostor syndrome is kind of lowing my confidence, but I won't stop coding no matter what :)

### Day 7: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the Chrome JavaScript Debugger and continued watchandcode until version 9. Played with some DOM selectors and with HTML DOM events.

**Thoughts**: Today I rested a lot because I was really tired. I plan to finish my JavaScript review until 25/09 - Tuesday and then dive in ES6 study. Also I have to start doing small projects for my portfolio.

### Day 8: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactored some JavaScript code today and continued with DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: Haven't read any articles or relevant content today, but today I reserved more time to study JavaScript. Tomorrow I will do some assignments in a more appropriate space and code the whole day.

### Day 9: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied the concepts of agile methodologies (Kanban, Scrum, XP, etc) and learned about JavaScript DOM Event Delegation. Almost finishing watchandcode.

**Thoughts**: No relevants thoughts about programming today, but I applied to Gama. Looking forward to it!

### Day 10: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Practical JavaScript and learned a lot about Clean Code (now I want to read this [book](https://www.amazon.com.br/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)).

**Thoughts**: Now I will go serious to learn **ES6 for real**. I will study through freeCodeCamp, Le Wagon and Eloquent JavaScript. And after that, dive in either Vue.JS or React.JS.

### Day 11: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started freeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design Certification" and after that will start the "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification" (that includes ES6, Regex, OOP, Intermediate Programming, etc.) Also did some JavaScript exercises and received feedback from a job interview.

**Thoughts**: I screwed my interview because the interviewer thought that I copied and pasted my answer about 'Clean Code'. Actually I did a lot of research in lots of different websites to learn what it was about. Unfortunately it did not work out. I have to step up my communication and uniqueness of my responses. Also, I have decided to give myself the time span from today until day 20 to finish both certifications.

### Day 12: September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Almost halfway through the Responsive Web Design Certification. Reviewing some HTML, CSS and Applied Visual Design. Created a folder to document my journey using freeCodeCamp using git and github.

**Thoughts**: Today I felt overwhelmed with the amount of stuff that some job postings ask and that I want to learn. I only have to stick to the challenge and speed up my daily development. I feel like in the next days I will learn (and apply) a lot of useful stuff, specially the more advanced Ruby and JavaScript parts. Note to self: **Keep it up and don't drop the ball!**

### Day 13: September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Visual Design and started Applied Accessibility.

**Thoughts**: Today was more calm and I relaxed the whole day. Only studied the minimum for the challenge. Just a tranquil saturday.
