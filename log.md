# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to redo watchandcode.com again to sharpen my javascript after Le Wagon bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Setting up the repo for the challenge and the first lectures were quite easy

### Day 2: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to redo watchandcode JavaScript course creating an object and functions inside it and read an article about hosting on namecheap blog https://www.namecheap.com/blog/choose-the-right-hosting-option/

**Thoughts**: Today I got really lazy, but the lectures were quite easy and made me think the ruby way to do them.

### Day 3: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued watchandcode JavaScript course to review and did some Ruby challenges to practice for job online screenings. Learned some cool stuff about array methods in Ruby and got stuck in a problem reggarding hashes and arrays in Ruby. I have to study that more.

**Thoughts**: It is getting harder to code everyday because sometimes I just feel like not coding, but when I start things begin to set in motion. The hardest part today were the Ruby challenges.

### Day 4: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued watchandcode JavaScript course and finished version 6. Applyed to some jobs and did some coding challenges for practice. Did an actual job challenge and screwed so bad, but I learned a lot.

**Thoughts**: I tried to do a lot of hard stuff today without succeeding as I wished, but everyday is a new learning and I get one step closer, each day, to understand the whole picture.

### Day 5: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a project with Middleman and deployed the skeleton to github pages. I got robbed today and I don't have my phone anymore. I couldn't continue this night to follow the watchandcode JavaScript course because I went home to block my number and cellphone.

**Thoughts**: I think that I'll start doing daily pages with Middleman because I learn the best by doing projects instead of readind a lot and following tutorials a lot. I'm best suited to learn a few hours and then spend the rest of the day mastering that knowledge.

### Day 6: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued watchandcode until the version 7 + the interlude. Found out interesting resources to take inspiration such as [Awwwrds](https://www.awwwards.com/), [The FWA](https://thefwa.com/awards/page/1/) and [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/c/web/resources/landing). I also put in my list to be studied: continuous integration, TDD (Ruby: RSpec and Capybara; JavaScript: Mocha, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme), Scrum and Kanban (notions of them) etc.

**Thoughts**: Today I had a lot of free time, but I used most of it to focus on relaxing, but still managed to learn as I wanted. I have to master Vue.JS as soon as I can and that may be my priority in October after I finish the basic javascript review and the ES6 review after that. Impostor syndrome is kind of lowing my confidence, but I won't stop coding no matter what :)

### Day 7: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the Chrome JavaScript Debugger and continued watchandcode until version 9. Played with some DOM selectors and with HTML DOM events.

**Thoughts**: Today I rested a lot because I was really tired. I plan to finish my JavaScript review until 25/09 - Tuesday and then dive in ES6 study. Also I have to start doing small projects for my portfolio.

### Day 8: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refactored some JavaScript code today and continued with DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts**: Haven't read any articles or relevant content today, but today I reserved more time to study JavaScript. Tomorrow I will do some assignments in a more appropriate space and code the whole day.

### Day 9: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied the concepts of agile methodologies (Kanban, Scrum, XP, etc) and learned about JavaScript DOM Event Delegation. Almost finishing watchandcode.

**Thoughts**: No relevants thoughts about programming today, but I applied to Gama. Looking forward to it!
