# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to redo watchandcode.com again to sharpen my javascript after Le Wagon bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Setting up the repo for the challenge and the first lectures were quite easy

### Day 2: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to redo watchandcode JavaScript course creating an object and functions inside it and read an article about hosting on namecheap blog https://www.namecheap.com/blog/choose-the-right-hosting-option/

**Thoughts**: Today I got really lazy, but the lectures were quite easy and made me think the ruby way to do them.


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
